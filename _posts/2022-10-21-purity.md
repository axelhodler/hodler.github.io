### Three examples.

Is this a _pure_ function?

{% highlight javascript %}
const add = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2
{% endhighlight %}

How about this?

{% highlight javascript %}
const getCurrentMonthIndex = () => new Date().getMonth()
{% endhighlight %}

Or this?

{% highlight javascript %}
const log = (msg) => console.log(msg)
{% endhighlight %}

Well, what is a pure function?

### Definition

> A function is pure when given the same input, we __always__ get the same output

### Example 1
Given 2 and 3 `add` will always yield 5

{% highlight bash %}
> add(2,3)
5
{% endhighlight %}

Thus ✅. A pure function

### Example 2
Given no input `getCurrentMonthIndex` will return us `9` as long as we are in October.
As soon as we enter November it will return the number `10`.

{% highlight bash %}
> getCurrentMonthIndex()
9
{% endhighlight %}

Same input - not same output.

Thus ❌. Not a pure function

### Example 3

Given the String `"hello"` `log` will always print `"hello"` to the console.

{% highlight bash %}
> log("hello")
hello
{% endhighlight %}

Same input, same output. A pure function?

What if?

{% highlight bash %}
> const console = "broken"
> log("hello")
Uncaught TypeError: console.log is not a function
    at log (REPL1:1:30)
{% endhighlight %}

By redefining `console` we changed the behaviour of our `log` function.
Same input. Different output. As was expected.

❌ Not a pure function

So - How did we find out if these functions are pure?

Pretty much by reading the their implementation details.

Their function body.

And, of course, by testing (calling, invoking) them.

Super easy to do that with one-liners. Hard with functions spanning tens, hundreds or thousands of lines in length.

### Creating purity

Can we rewrite both `getCurrentMonthIndex` and `log` to be pure?

Of course. We only need to declare their hidden inputs.

For the `getCurrentMonthIndex` it is the `new Date()` and for `log` the `console`.

{% highlight javascript %}
> const getCurrentMonthIndex = (today) => today.getMonth()
> getCurrentMonthIndex(new Date())
9
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
> const log = (logger, msg) => logger.log(msg)
> log(console, "hello")
hello
{% endhighlight %}

Is this helpful code? Is this good code?

Up for the reader to decide.

Have we made the hidden inputs visible?

No, there is is still the [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) present in all JavaScript functions.
It is hidden but its there.

Are the functions pure?

Depends. Whether we consider them are pure or not - we probably can agree that they are _more pure_ than they were before.

How did we find out if these functions are pure?

We did so by reading their code. Their implementation.

There is no other way of knowing!

Even if we call them with multiple inputs and check the output it is hard to cover the full space of available inputs.

Especially in the JavaScript case above where the input could be any type. We can add the Strings `'4' + '2'` and Numbers `4 + 2`.

Is there an alternative where we don't have to read the code?

Let's play with the programming language Haskell.

{% highlight haskell %}
sayHello :: String -> String
sayHello name = "Hello " ++ name
{% endhighlight %}

`sayHello` takes a `String` as an argument and returns a `String`

{% highlight bash %}
ghci> sayHello "Reader"
"Hello Reader"
{% endhighlight %}

An equivalent to `console.log()` would be `putStrLn`

{% highlight bash %}
ghci> putStrLn "Hello Reader"
Hello Reader
{% endhighlight %}

Let's use it inside of `sayHello`

{% highlight haskell %}
sayHello :: String -> String
sayHello name = putStrLn("Hello " ++ name)
{% endhighlight %}

Running this will give us an error.

{% highlight bash %}
test.hs:2:17: error:
    • Couldn't match type: IO ()
                     with: [Char]
      Expected: String
        Actual: IO ()
    • In the expression: putStrLn ("Hello " ++ name)
      In an equation for ‘sayHello’:
          sayHello name = putStrLn ("Hello " ++ name)
  |
2 | sayHello name = putStrLn("Hello " ++ name)
  |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
{% endhighlight %}

String is expected and actual is `IO ()`. The compiler does not allow us to do that.

We have to define the side-effect (`putStrLn`) in the function definition.

{% highlight haskell %}
sayHello :: String -> IO ()
sayHello name = putStrLn("Hello " ++ name)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
ghci> sayHello "Reader"
Hello Reader
{% endhighlight %}

So what?

We don't have to read the implementation to learn whether the function is pure or not. Only the type signature!

A function taking `String` as input and returning a `String` as output is pure. It has to be.

Haskell is considered a _purely_ functional programming language. Not because it has pure functions but because expressions in Haskell can be expressed exclusively in terms of a lambda calculus.

Lambda calculus?

Well, maybe something for our next post :)
