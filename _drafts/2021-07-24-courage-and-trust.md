Courage is regarded as a virtue, something to strive for. Most people would love to be more courageous. Trust is a double edged sword. It is regarded as necessary for successful relationships between humans, animals or other entities. Trust is something you have to earn. Unearned Trust could be considered blind trust, people who trust blindly are regarded as stupid. People who trust the government are regarded as sheep and participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem are nudged to "Trust, but verify".

Trust is something you can lose and regain. The same goes for courage, you can be courageous at one point and a lose courage at the next.

When thinking about courage you might think about soldiers storming the beaches of normandy. Though for someone suffering of depression it requires courage to get out of bed.

A while back the management decided to streamline and reduce the guiding principles for our company. The amount was reduced from 9 to 7. Previously they have contained Trust and Openness and now both of them were removed. We kept Courage, Commitment, Focus, Respect, .

There was a vote and Courage won. The argument was how Courage covers Trust and Openness. If you are courageous you are open. If you are open to someone you trust him.

It is all a matter of perspective. What is courage? Most people are not courageous. Take nazi germany. People would love to think they would be [Oskar Schindler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler), [Sophie Scholl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Scholl) or the family hiding [Anne Frank](). This is simply not true, there were a lot more people on the other side.

Back to business. In the modern office environment we are not required to storm MG nests with a grenade. What then is courage? I consider two ways. Having difficult conversations and trying new things.

Having diffcult conversations only requires courage if it is going up the chain of command. Does it take courage to talk to mention issues to your superior? Yes. Does it take courage to your subordinate? Not going to say no, but we can argue it takes a lot less courage than vice versa. The subordinate has more to lose.

Pretty early in my career I was able to 

It is a pyramid. Trust is the base layer.

Without trust you get fear of conflict. No difficult conversations, no debate, there is a fear of retribution. People could sabotage or outright fire you.

The moment people stop speaking up if they feel something is not right they stop caring. We are at lack of commitment. If we are not committed to achieving the goal of course we try to avoid accountability. After all it is probably not what we wanted in the first place. We did not speak up.

As soon as we avoid accountability we don't care about the results anymore. It is neither our fault nor do we care at all.

Thus I would change the argument to

Without trust you won't get openness and as a result won't be courageous.



There is another aspect of courage. The courage to try new things. Openness is the ability to try new things. It is a dimension of the big five personality traits.
